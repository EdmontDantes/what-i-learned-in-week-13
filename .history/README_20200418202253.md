### Stack & Queue

**Stack** is a limited data structure techniques where elements can be added and removed form the stack only from the top. Last in and Last out is the example given, which means we push (put on top) and pop (take out from the top) and no other operation can be done on the data.  
  
**Queue** is comparable to a ticket line. First in, First Out. The first person to be in line for the tickets gets the tickets and the next person in line is going to get the tickets. It is different form the stack where it get from the rear to the front is the flow of data.
