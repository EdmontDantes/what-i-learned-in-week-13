### Stack & Queue

**Stack** is a limited data structure techniques where elements can be added and removed form the stack only from the top. Last in and Last out is the example given, which means we push (put on top) and pop (take out from the top) and no other operation can be done on the data.  
  
**Queue** is comparable to a ticket line. First in, First Out. The first person to be in line for the tickets gets the tickets and the next person in line is going to get the tickets. It is different form the stack where it get from the rear to the front is the flow of data.

### linked list single & double  

**Linked list single** has a head of data where we can start searching for data connections from. Each node of data is connected with the next link to the next node until we reach tail where the node with the tail will have a link to the next node a null value. in order to find the last tail we have to loop through each link to find the last node. Single list is different from double list.
  
**Linked list double** has a had
