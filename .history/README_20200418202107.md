### Stack and Queue

**Stack** is a limited data structure techniques where elements can be added and removed form the stack only from the top. Last in and Last out is the example given, which means we push (put on top) and pop (take out from the top) and no other operation can be done on the data.  
  
**Queue** is comparable to a ticket line.
